# Hotel_OverBooking_Sys

## This is a Demo for our Hotel OverBooking Management System.

This is a small part of our hotel revenue management system. In this demo, we use the passenger flow forecasting model to calculate the hotelâ€™s revenue in the case of oversold by assuming that the hotel is in the scenario of oversold rooms, and assist the hotel in improving the overall benefit.
